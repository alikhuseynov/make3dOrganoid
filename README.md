### make3dOrganoid
This is the method to obtaind 3D brain organoid model reconstructions from 2D bright field images using R. 
Detailed steps can be found in [manual](https://github.com/alikhuseynov/make3dOrganoid/blob/master/workflow_manual.txt) and in [.Rmd script](https://github.com/alikhuseynov/make3dOrganoid/blob/master/scripts/main_scr_vignettes.Rmd)

Image data was taken from Li et al., 2017 [Induction of Expansion and Folding in Human Cerebral Organoids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28041895)

#### *Note: R version 3.3 was used here.* You will need to compile the packages/libraries that are used in [Rmd script](https://github.com/alikhuseynov/make3dOrganoid/blob/master/scripts/main_scr_vignettes.Rmd)
